To try a development build plugin on an app, run from the root of `dd-sdk-react-native`:

-   `(cd packages/expo && yarn clean && yarn build)`
-   `yarn workspace expo-datadog pack`

Copy the generated archive to the root of your app, and change your `package.json` to install the package from the archive (change the version number accordingly):

```json
"expo-datadog": "./expo-datadog-v45.0.0.tgz",
```

Run `yarn install` from your app, then run `expo prebuild` to see the changes in the native files. If it looks good to you, [start an EAS build][3] to test your changes.

**N.B.**: To avoid issues with the npm cache, change the name of the archive every time you test a new version (e.g. expo-datadog-v45.0.1-test-1.tgz).
